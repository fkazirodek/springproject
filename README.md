# springproject
This is my first Spring Boot web application. I used the following technologies in my project:
- Spring (Boot, MVC, Data, Security, DI)
- Thymeleaf
- Hibernate
- MySQL

The project has such functionalities as:
- ability to log in and register a user (with validation of the entered       data and password reminder)
- possibility of selling and buying items
- view transaction history
- posting comments to the purchase transaction
- Send an email with a verification token to activate account and send an     email after the purchase is complete
